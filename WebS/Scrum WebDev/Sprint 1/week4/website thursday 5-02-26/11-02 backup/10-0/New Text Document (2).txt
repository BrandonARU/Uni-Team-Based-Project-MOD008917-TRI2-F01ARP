 here is my html and i want to build a css for its header  background and footer which will be applicable through the whole website. both header and footer should take the whole horizontal space of the page.   both header and footer must have white tahoma font which goes smallest not smaller than WCAG 2.2 AA recommendation.  headerMain should be colour #6600cc colour.  .  headerBorder should be aligned to center and have some padding on left and right . its inside elements should aslo be padded from each other but no too much. headerLogoImg  and headerTitleDiv must both enlarge 1.4 on hover and be always a bit padded from left and right.  headerSearchDIv should be shrinking to a small thingy only on narrow screens, and be white inside and black font inside. all of class headerNavButton should be colour #6600cc but radially gradient with white colour - #6600cc in the middle and edges white. all of class headerNavButton should enlarge 1.4 on hover and change colour on hover to a lighter purple.  when on narrow screens the navbar should transorm into hamburger menu, and only buttons 1 2 3 4 in the menu should appear.   the text on buttons should always be within buttons and smaling down together with buttons when on smaller screens. the whole header should not be sticky, and not to tall.  in the body the background should be an image ..url/ background-light.png when light mode and dark when dark mode. the font of body should always be tahoma and white.   footer should be #6600cc colour.  footerLogoDiv and footerTitleDiv must be aligned to the left , footerLogoDiv should be above footerTitleDiv, both should enlarge on hover to 1.4. footerLogoDiv should hide on narrow screens. on mobile narrow screens all elements of footer apart of footerTitleDiv should be hidden.  footerPannelBorders 1,2,3 should be of the same width aligned and spread across the bigger screens evenly. the font should be always white. when hovering over them they should become pale purple and enlarge.

                        <p>We explain maths so clearly your brain finally stops buffering and goes “oh for f***’s sake, that’s it,” even if you’re the lost genius who feels like a kettle just about to whistle every time someone says ‘quadratic.’ If maths makes you want to run away and play football, if seeing a formula paralyses your thinking like a lag spike in real life, you’re exactly the kind of confused legend we live for. Our lessons are made for people who look at equations and immediately feel personally disrespected, irritated like a caged tiger when someone mutters “trigonometry.” We slow maths down, sit it in a chair, and force it to explain itself like it owes you money, because when ‘math terminology’ looks more like a line of swear words than something human, we’ve got your back. If numbers have ever made you feel stupid, annoyed, or aggressively tired for no reason, yeah, same — that’s why this exists. After our lessons, maths suddenly switches from nightmare fuel to “wait… why was that even hard,” and you might even catch yourself laughing at a fraction. This method has been tested on people who gave up, swore they were hopeless, and started beefing with calculators. Even the nastiest formulas eventually shut up, sit down, and behave. If you’ve been lost in maths since year seven and never emotionally recovered, this is your healing arc. No genius nonsense, no “it’s obvious” rubbish, just explanations that actually make sense. You don’t need a big brain, just a functioning one and maybe a snack. If maths is your sworn enemy and this is your last desperate attempt before rage-quitting forever, congratulations — you’ve finally found the place where it might actually click.</p>

                        <p>Maths here isn’t a lecture, it’s more like football — you learn by playing, missing shots, and suddenly scoring bangers. We’ve got quizzes and games for every so-called idiot on the planet, including the ones who swear maths hates them personally. Don’t make your mum embarrassed by saying “I’m just bad at maths” ever again. Learn it through play so hard that your mates stuck memorising history dates start getting jealous while you’re having fun. While they’re drowning in geography maps, you’re casually smashing maths levels like it’s a game night. Your mum and dad will start whispering to each other like “since when is this one obsessed with maths?” You’ll get so submerged in maths games it’s like the headteacher got stuck in chewing gum and can’t pull you out. TikTok? Forgotten. Football match? Missed. Brain? Fully hijacked by numbers. You’ll sit in front of our website clicking quizzes like a caffeinated hamster with Wi-Fi. Maths stops being homework and becomes your second personality. At some point you start emitting low-level genius radiation detectable from miles away. People won’t know what happened, only that you played maths instead of running from it.</p>
